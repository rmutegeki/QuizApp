# QuizApp
Following completion of the Android Basics course on the Udacity Platform, ths was the final project based on a provided rubric that can be obtained from https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/158/view. A user can download the app's apk from https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KwJaAvPlZsrw9wxyybr1hFglODt9J2NT with ease and after installation is able to answer a couple of Java related questions. 
The Questions are a mixture of Multiple choice, single choice, free text writing. A user chooses whether they enjoyed the quiz or not. The app then grades the user's responses and grades him/her. 
A Toast of the results is displayed when the "View Result" button is clicked.
When the user selects to "Email Result", an email is composed using their preferred email client.
Enjoy!!
